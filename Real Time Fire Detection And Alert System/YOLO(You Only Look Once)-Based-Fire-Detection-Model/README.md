# Fire and Smoke Detection using YOLOv8

A real-time fire and smoke detection system developed using YOLOv8 (Ultralytics). This project identifies fire and smoke in video frames using a pre-trained YOLOv8 model. The system tracks detected fire and smoke across frames for continuous monitoring, making it suitable for safety and monitoring applications.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Detects fire and smoke in video frames with high accuracy using YOLOv8.
- **Tracking**: Tracks detected fire and smoke across multiple frames for continuous monitoring.
- **Custom Dataset Training**: Trains YOLOv8 model with a custom fire and smoke dataset using Roboflow for dataset management and annotation.
- **Visualization**: Annotated frames with detected objects (fire/smoke) are saved and can be visualized.

## Technologies Used

- **Model Framework**: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) for object detection
- **Dataset Management**: Roboflow (for dataset annotation and management)
- **Backend Framework**: Python (for model training and inference)
- **GPU Acceleration**: CUDA (for faster inference on supported GPUs)
- **Libraries**: OpenCV (for video processing and frame handling)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) (if using GPU acceleration)
- [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov8)

### Steps to Set Up Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fire-detection-yolov8.git
   cd fire-detection-yolov8
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

   For Windows:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   For Mac/Linux:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required libraries using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Prepare the Dataset**

   - Use Roboflow to create and annotate a custom dataset for fire and smoke detection.
   - Download the dataset using the following code:

     ```python
     from roboflow import Roboflow
     rf = Roboflow(api_key="your_api_key")
     project = rf.workspace("your_workspace").project("your_project")
     dataset = project.version(1).download("yolov8")
     ```

5. **Train the Model**

   Train the YOLOv8 model with your custom dataset:

   ```bash
   yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8n.pt data=your_custom_data.yaml epochs=50 imgsz=640
   ```

6. **Run Inference**

   After training, run inference on a test video or image:

   ```bash
   yolo task=detect mode=predict model=path_to_model weights=yolov8n.pt source=path_to_video_or_image save=True
   ```

   This will generate annotated frames with fire and smoke detections and save them to the `runs/predict` folder.

## How the System Works

- **Detection**: The system uses YOLOv8 to detect fire and smoke in real-time video frames. The model can be trained on a custom dataset for improved accuracy.
- **Tracking**: Detected fire and smoke are tracked across subsequent frames to monitor their movement.
- **Results**: Annotated frames showing fire and smoke are saved, and the results can be viewed or exported.
